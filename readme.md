*Style Notes*
This one appears complicated, and after styling all the layouts, while I'm happy with the end-result, not so happy with the state of my CSS. There are things in the design that just necessitate individual rules for each layout, like different padding widths for all three. The ones I found most difficult to work with were all the unique changes to the fonts, like letter-spacing. I do think I want to revisit those more challenging aspects of the CSS to see if I can't refactor, identifying patterns where I didn't see them before. And I do realize that with a more complex design like this one, I may just need to spend more time over each individual aspect, figuring out how each works, by itself as well as the whole.

I have about 600 lines of CSS and that just really seems excessive. I'll see what I can do about that after creating some functionality.

Also, the font they used is different on Google Fonts. I sourced the original but that definitely threw me off for a bit.
